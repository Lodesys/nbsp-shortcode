Replaces the `[nbsp]` shortcode with the `&nbsp;` character entity string.


## Description

Replaces a `[nbsp]` shortcode with the `&nbsp;` character entity string - use when
formatting poetry or anywhere you need a no-break space.

Required as the wordpress editor eats `&nbsp;` most of the time, especially at
the beginning of a line of text.


## Installation

1. First make sure you have [GitHub Updater](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater) installed.
2. In the WordPress Dashboard go to Settings > GitHub Updater > Install Plugin.
3. Enter `Lodesys/nbsp-shortcode` as the Plugin URI and make sure the Remote Repository Host is `GitHub`. Then click the "Install Plugin".
4. Activate the plugin after it has installed.

When the plugin is updated, GitHub Updater will notify WordPress to present the usual offers to update the plugin for you.


## Frequently Asked Questions

#### How do I insert a no break space?
